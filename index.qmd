Hello!

I am a Master’s student in Geospatial Environmental Management (MGEM) at the University of British Columbia, with a Bachelor of Science in Environmental Geography from Concordia University. My academic background combines environmental science, remote sensing, and geospatial analysis, with a strong focus on applying spatial tools to real-world environmental and social challenges.

I have professional and research experience in environmental management, conservation, and data analysis, including an internship with MRF (Marine Research Foundation) in Malaysia where I worked on spatio-temporal analyses to support fisheries conservation and policy. I am particularly interested in community-driven research, environmental justice, and the role of geospatial technologies in supporting equitable and sustainable decision-making.

Outside of academics, I am an avid rock climber and enjoy spending time outdoors. I value interdisciplinary work, collaboration, and using technical skills to contribute to meaningful environmental action.
