    "text": "Hello!\nI am a Master’s student in Geomatics for Environmental Management (MGEM) at the University of British Columbia, with a Bachelor of Science in Environmental Geography from Concordia University. My academic background combines environmental science, remote sensing, and geospatial analysis, with a strong focus on applying spatial tools to real-world environmental and social challenges.\nI have professional and research experience in environmental management, conservation, and data analysis, including an internship with MRF (Marine Research Foundation) in Malaysia where I worked on spatio-temporal analyses to support fisheries conservation and policy. I am particularly interested in community-driven research, environmental justice, and the role of geospatial technologies in supporting equitable and sustainable decision-making.\nOutside of academics, I am an avid rock climber and enjoy spending time outdoors. I value interdisciplinary work, collaboration, and using technical skills to contribute to meaningful environmental action."

    "text": "This is a sample page where you can archive project deliverables. Every header you use will correspond to a tab in the legend - shown on the right-hand side of your screen (“On this page”).\nIf you’ve produced any GIS layers for your 599 project, this may be a good place to share them as interactive maps through leaflet. Alternatively, you can upload high-res figures showing correlations, box-plots, etc. from your report here, and provide a brief overview of key project results. If you have written some useful functions, you may also want to share those here to demonstrate proficiency in particular coding languages or synergies between notable coding packages.\n\n\nSample leaflet - for detailed leaflet instructions, visit the FCOR 599 workshop archive page here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSample code snippet. Notice that you can provide a toggle to switch between coding languages - this is referred to as a ‘tabset’ in quarto. It is good practice to try and convert your R code to python, and vice-versa to demonstrate coding proficiency. For example, let’s showcase a function for calculating NDVI in R and Python.\n\nRPython\n\n\ncalc_ndvi &lt;- function(nir, red){\n  ndvi &lt;- (nir-red)/(nir+red)\n  return(ndvi)\n}\n(Assuming nir and red are terra rast objects)\n\n\ndef calc_ndvi(nir, red): \n  ndvi = (nir - red)/(nir + red)\n  return(ndvi)\n(Assuming nir and red are numpy arrays)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can also provide a frame linking to external websites. For example, here is a Google Earth Engine application I developed - which I embedded in this webpage using the code below:\n\n\n&lt;iframe width=\"900\" height=\"700\"\nsrc=\"https://ee-melserramon.projects.earthengine.app/view/thermal-analysis-tool\"&gt;\n&lt;/iframe&gt;\n\nThe full-screen GEE application is available here in case you’re interested.\n(To use the GEE tool, navigate to any city you’d like, hit apply filters, and click anywhere on the map to retrieve a time-series of Landsat surface temperature observations for that point. Areas where the maximum temp exceeded 35 degrees Celsius in your date-range are highlighted in red.)"

You can see the areas of increased elevation where the bigger boulders are.\n\nplot(apron_dtm)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is way more fun, and easier to see whats going on in 3D. The biggest boulder here is the Cacodemon boulder in Squamish with loads of famous routes on it.\n\n\nThe same workflow can be replicated in valleys anywhere to try and find new bouldering zones."
